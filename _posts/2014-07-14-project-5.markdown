description: I led our team's transition from having the university magazine website in no CMS (with each page hand-coded) to a customized Wordpress theme. <a href="https://response.spu.edu/"><em>Response</em> magazine</a> is published three times a year as a print magazine and intermittently publishes new content online as well.
